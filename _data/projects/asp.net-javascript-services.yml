  ASP.NET Javascript Services is a set of technologies for ASP.NET Core developers. 
  It provides infrastructure that you'll find useful if you use Angular 2 / React / Knockout / etc. on the client, 
  or if you build your client-side resources using Webpack, 
  or otherwise want to execute JavaScript on the server at runtime.
