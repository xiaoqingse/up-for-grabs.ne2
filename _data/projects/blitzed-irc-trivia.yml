name: Blitzed IRC Trivia
desc: Blitzed IRC Trivia is an IRC bot (Win32 exe now available!) that will connect to a server, join a channel, and ask trivia questions. Allows team or single-play, can use a phonetic pattern-matching algorithm (answers don't need to be exact), and has many other options. Originally developed by Eric Fears, now maintained by Andy Alt.
