  A GitHub pages repo for the Duality projects developer manual. If you 
  have a thing for technical writing and an affinity for game development, 
  we could use your help!
  Duality is a modular 2D game engine that provides its own visual editor. 
  It's highly extensible, written entirely in C# and backed by OpenGL.
